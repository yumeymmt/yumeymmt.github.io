My name is Yume, and I am going into third year of Engineering Science program at University of Toronto. 

I find passion in robotics, artificial intelligence, control systems and just building things in general! 
I also have strong interest in aerospace and biomedical systems, as well as in systems engineering. 

Head over to [Projects](https://academicpages.github.io/talks) page to see cool stuff.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
